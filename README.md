# Chat App

## Description
This is just a basic chat app that I'm messing around with. Nothing special The Verccel build (Production) currently does not work since they don't support websocket communication natively, but I may fix that in the future. For now, use the Heroku build (Super-chill-chat).

## Installation 
Run the following in the terminal.  ```npm i```This should install all necessary packages. From there, you can run locally using any of the scripts found in the package.json.
